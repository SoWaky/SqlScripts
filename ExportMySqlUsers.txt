#### Exporting Users and priveleges from the source database:
# Log onto the server with the source database.
# Open a Command Prompt.

# Change directory to the mysql.exe
CD "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin"

# run this command to log into the server as root and export the query below to users.txt
mysql -uroot -N -p -s > GetUsers.txt

# At the "Enter password:" prompt, enter the root password and hit Enter


# There will not be another prompt. It will be waiting for you to type this query and hit Enter:
SELECT Distinct CONCAT('show grants for `', user, '`@`', host, '`;') as query from mysql.user;

# Again, there will not be another prompt. Type this command and hit Enter
quit

# Type this new command. It will use the users textfile and build a new file called ImportUsers.txt 
#	that will have commands to create the users and assign permissions on the new server
mysql -uroot -N -p -s -r < GetUsers.txt > ImportUsers.txt

# At the "Enter password:" prompt, enter the root password and hit Enter
# This command will quit automatically.  You are done on the source server

#### Importing Users and priveleges into the destination database:
# Copy the ImportUsers.txt file to the destination server, in the same directory as mysql.exe
# Open a Command Prompt

# Change directory to the mysql.exe
CD "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\bin"

# run this command to log into the server as root and import the users
mysql -uroot -p < ImportUsers.txt

# At the "Enter password:" prompt, enter the root password and hit Enter
# This command will quit automatically.  You are done on the source server
